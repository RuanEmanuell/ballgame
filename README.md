## BallGame (temporary name)

It was (or is) going to be an AngryBirds-like game with where the player objective is to score the ball in the goal passing by the enemies. Inspired by the 2022 World Cup.

Development paused for a while because of the Brazil loss to Croatia in the penalties in the quarter finals. I will be focusing in other projects.
